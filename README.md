# MovieRaterApi
AGILE Group WebAPI Project

Thank you for checking out our Group MovieRaterAPI project! We completed this project utilizing an Agile methodology.
We utilized a Miro board with a Kanban style Agile task list to track tasks needing to be done, in progress, and completed.
The link to that Miro board can be seen here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOChjoIU=/?invite_link_id=43501011746
